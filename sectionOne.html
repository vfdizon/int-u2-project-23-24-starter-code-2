				<h1> My Story</h1>
				<p>
					I first learned to play trumpet when I was 9 years old. Back then, I didn't appreciate music as much. I just
					wanted to learn an instrument just because I wanted to learn how to play. I didn't listen to music, I didn't
					even appreciate music, that lead me to stop playing. In 6th grade, I got my first phone, and to be like
					everyone else, I listened to music. However, as I started listening to music, I slowly began to appreciate it,
					and eventually I wanted to learn electric bass in 8th grade, as I was inspired by Flea from the Red Hot Chili
					Peppers.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the middle of my journey through playing Bass, the COVID-19 pandemic began. Personally, I hate staying
					inside, cooped up. Quarentine was a big hit for me, I began to feel very down during my classes, and it was
					very hard for me to stay motivated, the only thing keeping me forward was the thought of "soon, I'll be back
					in person again", but to me it just seemed to never happen. Playing bass was a way for me to pass the time,
					vent my feelings in a musical way. I don't like being open about my feelings, but music allows me to vent my
					feelings sort of in an encoded manner, shrouded behind a veil of interperetation. And I got to create
					something beautiful sounding in that way.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, quarentine did end, and school resumed as usual. Online, I started beginning band, picking up the
					trumpet again, and I joined my school's jazz band, playing bass. I was able to connect with other musicians on
					bass, and I've made friends because of how we played together, and connected through music. Music wasn't just
					a way of venting my emotions, or just to pass the time, but it was a way of connection with other people,
					people I would have otherwise never have talked to, and I think thats why music has prevailed for so long,
					among conflict, and other misfortunes. It is because humans are social creatures and long for other human
					connection, and music is that connection through other people.
